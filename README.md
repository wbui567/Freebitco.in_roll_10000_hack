# Freebitco.in_roll_10000_hack

the code works for the site freebitco.in

it simulates the roll dice to always get 10000 (AKA $200).

line 47: localStorage["balance"]= number;
line 57: $("#balance")["html"](localStorage["balance"])

localStorage mean the modified values are stored in localStorage of your Browser

If you know how to POST the modified value, let me know, I'll update the script.
